            the use of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
            excluded. If your habitual residence is in the EU, and you are a consumer, you additionally possess the

            yourself both agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Bucharest, which means that

    <p class="c1"><span class="c10">Any dispute arising from the relationships between the Parties to this contract

            Rules of the European Court of Arbitration being part of the European Centre of Arbitration having its seat
            in Strasbourg, and which are in force at the time the application for arbitration is filed, and of which
            adoption of this clause constitutes acceptance. The seat of arbitration shall be Bucharest, Romania. The

            Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other
            proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or
            to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in
            a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</span></p>

            related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c)
            any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither
            Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal
            or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts
            listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that
            court.</span></p>
